### Pitch Detection Application
# Overview
This application uses real-time audio processing to detect pitch with the Yin algorithm and visualizes pitch values over time. It's built with React, utilizes the Web Audio API for audio capture, and Chart.js for dynamic data visualization.

### Features
Real-Time Pitch Detection: Analyzes live audio input to determine pitch using the Yin algorithm.
Dynamic Visualization: Plots detected pitch values on a responsive line chart.
